A node.js app to scrape imdb's lists into valid json, built to scrape the 1001 Movies To See Before You Die list for my Angular app `fishbowl`.

### Setup

Set the urls of all the pages in the `url` array, create a `list.json` file in the directory.

1) `npm install`  
2) `node server.js`  
3) Load `http://localhost:8081/scrape` to start the process.
